## MySQL CREATE TABLE
              A table is used to organize data in the form of rows and columns and used for both storing and displaying records in the structure format. 
              It is similar to worksheets in the spreadsheet application. 
              A table creation command requires three things:
                  Name of the table
                  Names of fields/column
                  Definitions for each field

              Syntax :
                  CREATE TABLE  table_name(  
                  column_definition1,  
                  column_definition2,  )
                                                                                                                    );  
## MySQL Show Table Data
             show tables ;



##  MySQL INSERT Statement
                 MySQL INSERT statement is used to store or add data in MySQL table within the database. 

                 Syntax :                                    
                	 INSERT INTO table_name ( field1, field2,...fieldN ) VALUES   ( value1, value2,...valueN ); 

## Select Query  
            Show data inside the Table 
                   select  *  from  table_name ;

## MySQL UPDATE Query
               The UPDATE statement is used with the SET and WHERE clauses.
	       Syntax : 
              	  UPDATE table_name SET column_name = new-value [WHERE Clause] ;

## MySQL DELETE Query
	      Syntax :
               	  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;  

## MySQL Aliases
           Aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
           Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
           An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
           An alias is created with the (AS) keyword.
	   Syntax :
		SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;



##  Practice :

1. Create Databases  Company
2. Create Tables In Database company 
                                  Create Table 1: employees  
                                             emp_id ,
                                             first_name ,

                                             mob_no,
                                             salary ,
                                              city

3. insert 10 record in employees Table
4. Update the salary of an employee with employee id =  101  to 50000.
5. Update the First name of an employee with employee id =  103  to Roshan.

10. Delete the employee with employee id  = 102.
11. Delete the employee  with employee first name  = Pratik.
12. Delete the employee  with employee last name  = Barse.
13. Delete the employee  with employee mobile number  = 123456987.
