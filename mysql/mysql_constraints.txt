##  MySQL Constraints
      The constraint in MySQL is used to specify the rule that allows or restricts what values/data will be stored in the table. They provide a suitable method to ensure data accuracy and integrity inside the table.It also helps to limit the type of data that will be inserted inside the table. 


Types of MySQL Constraints
1. NOT NULL : 
           NULL means empty, i.e., the value is not available. Whenever a table's column is declared as NOT NULL. the value for that column cannot be empty for any of the table's records. NULL does not mean zero. NULL means empty column, not even zero.

2. CHECK :
          Whenever a check constraint is applied to the table's column, and the user wants to insert the value in it.then the value will first be checked for certain conditions before inserting the value into that column.

3. DEFAULT : 
          Whenever a default constraint is applied to the table's column, and the user has not specified the value.to be inserted in it,  then the default value which was specified while applying the default constraint will be inserted  into that particular column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

4.PRIMARY KEY  :
             PRIMARY KEY Constraint is a combination of NOT NULL and Unique constraints. NOT NULL constraint and a UNIQUE constraint together forms a PRIMARY constraint.The column to which we have applied the primary constraint will always contain a unique value and will not allow null values.

5. AUTO_INCREMENT : 
             ALTER TABLE table_name AUTO_INCREMENT=100;

6. UNIQUE : 
       Duplicate values are not allowed in the columns to which the UNIQUE constraint is applied.
       The column with the unique constraint will always contain a unique value.This constraint can be      
       applied to one or more than one column of a table.    


## MySQL ORDER BY  Clause
        The MYSQL ORDER BY Clause is used to sort the records in ascending or descending order.
        Syntax : 
             SELECT expressions  FROM tables ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ];  

## MySQL DISTINCT Clause
        The DISTINCT clause in MySQL is used with a SELECT statement to return the distinct values      
        (unique values) from a single or multiple of columns in a table
        Syntax : 
            SELECT DISTINCT column1, DISTINCT column2 FROM table_name  ;

##  MySQL Operators

                1. Comparison Operators
