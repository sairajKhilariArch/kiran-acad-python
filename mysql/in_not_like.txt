## MySQL NULL Value And NOT NULL
        A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. If a field in a table is optional, it is 	possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field.
	Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value. A NULL value is different from a zero value or 	a field that contains spaces. 
	A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation! It is not 	possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

	Syntax : 
         SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;

         SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;


## MySQL IN And NOT IN OPERATOR
         The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. The IN operator is a 	  
         shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
         Syntax : 
            SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

            SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT IN (value1, value2, ...);

## MySQL BETWEEN And NOT BETWEEN OPERATOR
         The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: 	 
         begin and end values are included.
         Syntax : 
            SELECT column_name  FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

            SELECT column_name  FROM table_name WHERE column_name NOT BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

## MySQL LIKE OPERATOR
         There are two wildcards characters  in LIKE operator: The percent sign (%) represents zero, 		 one, or multiple characters The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character

  LIKE Operator	                              Description
  WHERE Column_name LIKE 'a%'	  :    Finds any values that start with "a"
  WHERE Column_name LIKE '%a'	  :    Finds any values that end with "a"
  WHERE Column_name LIKE '%or%'   :    Finds any values that have "or" in any position
  WHERE Column_name LIKE '_r%'	  :    Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
  WHERE Column_name LIKE 'a_%'	  :    Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2        
                                       characters in length
  WHERE Column_name LIKE 'a__%'   :    Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3  
                                       characters in length
  WHERE Column_name LIKE 'a%o'	  :    Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

## Subquery

A subquery is a query written inside another SQL query.
The inner query runs first, and its result is used by the outer query.

📘 Also called Nested Query.
General Syntax
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name OPERATOR (
    SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
);
