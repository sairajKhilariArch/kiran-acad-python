##  Database
       A database is an application that stores the organized collection of records. 
       It can be accessed and manage by the user very easily. 
       It allows us to organize data into tables, rows, columns, and indexes to find the relevant information very quickly. 
       Each database  performing database operations such as creating, managing, accessing, and searching the data it stores. 
       Today, many databases available like MySQL,  Oracle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc. 

## Importance of Databases for Different Technology
       1. Databases for Web Development
	  Web applications rely heavily on databases to store and manage user data, content, and transactions. 
	  Whether it is a blog or a large e-commerce platform, developers typically use:
	  Popular Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase
	  Use Case: Dynamic content, authentication, product catalogs

       2. Databases for Data Science
          Data scientists need flexible querying, data aggregation, and easy integration with tools like Python and R.
          Popular Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Apache Hive, Snowflake
          Use Case: Feature extraction, exploratory analysis, modeling datasets

       3. Databases for Artificial Intelligence
          AI systems depend on structured, unstructured, and streaming data for model training and predictions.
          Popular Databases: MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Google BigQuery, AWS S3 (data lake)
          Use Case: Storing training datasets, real-time inference, model feedback loops

       4. Database for Cloud Computing
          In cloud-native environments, databases must support autoscaling, high availability, and service integration.
          Popular Databases: Amazon Aurora, Google Cloud Spanner, Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB
          Use Case: SaaS platforms, distributed apps, serverless environments

## Types of Databases            
     1.  Relational Database
           This database is based on the relational data model.
           which stores data in the form of rows(tuple) and columns(attributes), and together forms a table(relation). 
           A relational database uses SQL for storing, manipulating, as well as maintaining the data. 
           Each table in the database carries a key that makes the data unique from others. 
           Examples of Relational databases are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, etc.

     2. NoSQL Database
          Non-SQL/Not Only SQL is a type of database that is used for storing a wide range of data sets. 
          It is not a relational database as it stores data not only in tabular form but in several different ways.
          Examples include MongoDB (document store), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database), and Cassandra (wide-	  column store).


## MySQL
     MySQL is a relational database management system based on the Structured Query Language. (SQL)
     MySQL is currently the most popular database management system software used for managing the relational database. 
     It is open-source database software, which is supported by Oracle Company.
     It is fast, scalable, and easy to use database management system in comparison with Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle     
     Database. 


## How MySQL Works

                                                          send Request
                                                        ------------------------->         
                                   client                                                      Database 
                                                        <------------------------      
                                                           return Response                                   

##  MySQL Data Types
      1. Numeric Data Type
         INT 
         BIGINT
         FLOAT( 1 , 2)                                                 
         DOUBLE( size , d)

      2. Date and Time Data Type
         YEAR :  yy / yyyy
         DATE  :  'yyyy-mm-dd'
         TIME :  'HH:MM:SS'
         DATETIME :   'yyyy-mm-dd  hh:mm:ss'.

      3. String Data Types 
          CHAR(size)
          VARCHAR(size)
          TEXT(size)

## SQL Commands  
     Types of SQL Commands
         1. DDL (Data Definition Language) :                                                            
             Create    : Creates a new table, a view on a table, or some other object in the database.
             Drop      : Deletes an entire table, a view of a table, or other objects in the database
             Alter     : Modifies an existing database object, such as a table
             Truncate  : Removes all records from a table but keeps the table structure intact.
             Rename    : It is used to change the name of an existing database object, such as a table

         2. DML (Data Manipulation Language) :  
             Insert  : Creates a record
             Update  : Modifies records.
             Delete  : Deletes records.

         3. DQL (Data Query Language ) : 
             Select

	 4. DCL (Data Control language):
	     GRANT   : Gives a privilege to the user.
	     REVOKE  : Takes back privileges granted by the user
