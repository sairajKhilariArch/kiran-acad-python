#* 1)What is Inheritance in Python?

            #?  Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
            
            # ?It allows a class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called a parent class or superclass).
            
            # ?Inheritance allows for code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes. The child class can use the functionalities of the parent class and also add its own unique behaviors.

# *2)what are Key Features of Inheritance?

    # *Code Reusability:
    
            # ?The child class can inherit methods and properties from the parent class, the need to rewrite common functionality.
            
    # *Extensibility:
    
            # ?The child class can add or override methods and properties to extend or customize the behavior of the parent class.
